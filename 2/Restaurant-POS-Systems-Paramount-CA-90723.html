<p>The core of hospitality or retail business, for that matter any trade, is the cash register. A POS system provides the latest sales reports for the day, week, month, or year. You'll want to use POS software that integrates seamlessly with your other systems and causes limited disruption. In essence, Upserve POS provides tools for customer management, restaurant management, table management, and specialty order processing. Some restaurant point of sale systems come standard with an "86 Item Countdown" feature that displays actual counts, deducts from the count when an item is sold and then prevents sales of the item once it is sold out.</p>
<p>For instance, POS systems for the restaurant business can enhance customer loyalty and retention by being used for promotions via email or sms. Your customers don't have to worry about keeping cash in their pockets all the time. This computerized system allows business owners to track sales, cash flow , food inventory and can help simplify your bookkeeping enormously. QuickBooks POS is yours with a one-time payment: no more monthly, quarterly or annual payments to worry about.</p>
