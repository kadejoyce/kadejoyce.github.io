<p>Integrating the POS system with Apparel ERP will demand an understanding and the need of POS system. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>This meant that the business either opted not to accept those forms of payment or accepted them knowing that there was a possibility that they would never actually receive the payment as it was hard to verify the accounts.

<p>The most prominent makers of iPad POS systems also piggyback their point-of-sale solutions with digital menus that are powered by the iPad tablets. The small businesses hold the basic features of the POS system, so their prices are more affordable rather than the large organizations that believe in investing in the plans that offer more advanced features. In short the software makes running the retail store easily and conveniently.</p>
