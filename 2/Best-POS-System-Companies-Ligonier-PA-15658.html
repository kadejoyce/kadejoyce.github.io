Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city. There is only 1 thing we can think of that will drive customers away faster than bad food and that is slow service.</p>
