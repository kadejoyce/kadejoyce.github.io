<p>Updating your point of sale (POS) systems can help you to provide better customer service, increase your stock control, increase staff efficiency, reduce theft at the point of sale, and provide customers with more information. Otherwise, your business's and your customers' financial information could be at risk. With handheld technology designed for the restaurant environment, you can enable your team to spend more time with guests, accelerate service, and speed up checkout through tableside ordering and payments.

<h2>Easy To Use POS System Forest Grove OR</h2>
<p>Labor Management and Payroll : A restaurant POS system can act as an employee time clock, with servers and staff signing in and out according to their schedules. In comparison, a customized restaurant POS system bundled with a restaurant POS PC and restaurant POS Software will allow your business do so much more. But when you are dealing with back-office functions like personnel management or inventory, things can sometimes go wrong.</p>
<p>The reporting functionality allows managers to see their sales broken down by item sales, discounts and comps, refunds, net sales, and taxes in a searchable interface that can display revenue from the past week, past 30 days, or other set timeframe.

<p>With Harbortouch's free POS program, we'd be remiss by not adding a retail point of sale system to our product line of software and hardware products. The user can use cash, debit cards, mobile payments, or credit cards for the payment. It can be all too easy to lose track of someone's drink order or miss a customer waiting to place a drink order at the bar. Here is an ugly truth: No matter how credit card improves, cash still holds its position on consumers' behavior.</p>
