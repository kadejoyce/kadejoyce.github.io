<p>It used to be that for a small retail business, a cash register and a black-box credit card terminal were sufficient. Before the introduction of technology into the restaurants, bills were traditionally generated by merely calculating the order value manually and giving customers a handwritten receipt. The payment options offered, the speed of the transaction, and the ability to tailor the transaction to the customers' needs each have profound impacts on customer satisfaction and your overall business success. It is advisable to use your POS computer exclusively for the purpose it is meant for - recording sales transactions, generating reports and managing inventory.</p>
<p>We created Point of Success Special Edition for independent restaurants, coffee shops, cafes, bars, and quick service concepts like yours. The one thing that can take a long time when hiring a bartender for the first time is training them to learn your POS system.

<p>Retailers have the ability to implement special promotions or establish customer loyalty programs to encourage customers to purchase popular items. This will include hardware components like credit card readers, touchscreen monitors, receipt printers, and barcode scanners. Traditional card machines require software installation (if not included) and SIM card or landline cable, while app-based card readers use WiFi or network data from a connected mobile device.</p>

Square is a common favorite of mobile businesses like food trucks and boutique retail shops. Either one of these will help brick and mortar retailers switch to an easier to use and more affordable POS.
