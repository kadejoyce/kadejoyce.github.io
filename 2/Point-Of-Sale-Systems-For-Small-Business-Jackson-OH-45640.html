<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>

<p>You should consider storing your data with a business-grade cloud storage provider that's secure and make sure that every session between your point-of-sale system and any remote location are secured through a virtual private network (VPN). It also features real-time analytics for sales tracking and other key performance indicators with actionable insights. Maybe your store makes many sales throughout the day that involve several smaller items, so a system with a scanner built into the counter might be more efficient.</p>
