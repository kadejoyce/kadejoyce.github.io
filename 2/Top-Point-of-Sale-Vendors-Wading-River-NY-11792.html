<p>Like their printer counterpart an all-in-one POS system combines multiple technologies and integrates them into one housing to maximize value plus convenience to the end user. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>This meant that the business either opted not to accept those forms of payment or accepted them knowing that there was a possibility that they would never actually receive the payment as it was hard to verify the accounts. Financial Statements: Finally, one of the most important features of a restaurant POS system. When you install new point of sale software for your business, make sure that your employers attend a mandatory training session to acquaint them with the intricacies of the program.</p>
