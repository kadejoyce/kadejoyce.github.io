<p>The application is designed for ease of use, so you don't need vast technical background to navigate through the application and start processing sales orders, payments, and shipping. On-Premise - There are broad ranges of features in on-premise modules, and it is difficult and time-consuming to add new functionalities in this POS solution. If a restaurant operates from more than one location, it can maintain a centralized, POS enabled inventory management system instead of visiting every location in person to supervise.</p>
