<p>Learn what features to look for when choosing the best retail POS system for your company. ChronitoPOS makes customer relationship management easy. Reprint this ticket 10 times and sell and collect for themselves these reprinted receipts instead of ringing up new customers. The software lets you stay on top of purchase orders, keep tabs on vendor orders by product, organize multiple vendors in one place, as well as run reports to instantly see your best sellers, total sales, and total taxes.
