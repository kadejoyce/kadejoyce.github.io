<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>Gone are those days when retailers used a cash register to process sales after which the data was transferred to accounts and stock list. It's a proven fact that when customers open bar tabs, they spend more. Whether you have single or multiple stores, our tools help run your business. A decent POS computer system provides features to manage a large company database, that can be conceivably shared amongst multiple store locations.</p>
