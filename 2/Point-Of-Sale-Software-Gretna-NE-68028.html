Japanese Restaurant POS System : Again, a multi-language interface means that staff can process orders in either English or Japanese. Tablet-based POS Most POS systems are optimized to run on an iPad or similar tablet, saving restaurant owners money by being easily replaceable and not requiring a computer mouse or keyboard.</p>
