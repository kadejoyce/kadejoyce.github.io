<p>The core of hospitality or retail business, for that matter any trade, is the cash register. A POS system provides the latest sales reports for the day, week, month, or year. You'll want to use POS software that integrates seamlessly with your other systems and causes limited disruption. In essence, Upserve POS provides tools for customer management, restaurant management, table management, and specialty order processing.

The POS is the place in a shop where a product is passed from the seller to the customer POS is an abbreviation for 'point of sale'. Bring your in-store and online sales together with Shopify.
