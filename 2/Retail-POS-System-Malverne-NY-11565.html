<p>Most of us remember the early days when retail systems were just a cash register. Hardware — Many POS systems come with hardware such as cash drawers, tablets, card readers, and ticket printers. You can download and install Retail Plus POS software in a matter of minutes.

<p>Point of sales systems of today function analogously to the commonplace personal computer and can run other software other than the standard POS software that is provided as standard with the purchase of the system.

<p>It is a must in retail stores earning revenue above $7, 00,000. Nightclub or bar POS software with preauthorization will also immediately tokenize and encrypt customer credit card information when it's swiped, so no sensitive information is stored on the device.

<p>Bear in mind that if you will be accepting debit and credit cards (which are required by most businesses), you need a service that will process all of your payments. A specialized system with bar-specific features will do so much more for your business than a general POS. Features include appointment scheduling, employee management, inventory tracking, integrated payment processing, and gift card and loyalty programs.</p>
