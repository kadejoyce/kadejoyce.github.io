<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments. Be cautious, therefore, about setting up with Quickbooks or other proprietary POS software systems.</p>
<p>Anything that helps you streamline staff management—and potentially lower labor costs—is a plus. Therefore restaurant POS may boast a customer friendly menu interface to support this. Touch screen menus, remote ordering, staff supervision, automated billing, and organization of customer accounts are all possible with the restaurant point of sale software. However, if the system does not run reliably, it can cause serious headaches for both management and wait staff.</p>

<p>TigerPOS is an easy-to-use, touchscreen POS system for bars and liquor stores. In just a few clicks, your servers can easily split between card and cash payments. Shopify POS prices start at $29 per month- a bargain, though growing businesses might want to pick the $79 per month ‘Shopify' plan to access advanced reporting and other impactful functions. A POS system helps a businessman to manage stock in his go down, tender payment to creditors, print reports, and manage various other activities.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that not all restaurant POS systems are one-size-fits-all solutions. Eliminating a fixed bar POS system can raise a bar's customer experience to new heights by creating a modern sales experience that is rife with today's latest technology. If you need internal security, manage data access with employee passcodes for checking individual sales and refunds. It also offers software for business intelligence, analytics and customer engagement.</p>
