<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments. Be cautious, therefore, about setting up with Quickbooks or other proprietary POS software systems.</p>
<p>Gone are those days when retailers used a cash register to process sales after which the data was transferred to accounts and stock list. It's a proven fact that when customers open bar tabs, they spend more. Whether you have single or multiple stores, our tools help run your business. A decent POS computer system provides features to manage a large company database, that can be conceivably shared amongst multiple store locations.</p>

Loyverse, which stands for Loyalty Universe,” is a good free mobile POS software. Basic systems include an electronic cash register and software to coordinate data collected from daily purchases. Retail 4.0 will see retailers integrating their offline and online sales via IoT-enabled POS such that customers can shop online and pick up in the store or vice versa.</p>
<p>Cross Channel returns management- The POS returns management system accepts the cross-channel returns and assists in refunds along with replacements from any type of store location. More importantly, however, the right POS system will allow bar and nightclub staff to spend less time in front of the screen and more time in front of customers, pouring delicious drinks. In a way, this is similar to the purpose behind restaurants: A restaurant's basic function is to feed people, but you and your staff do way more than that by creating delightful, memorable dining experiences.</p>

Loyverse POS is a free point-of-sale application and is especially suited for bars, coffee shops, and restaurants. Vend goes beyond the basics with features like inventory management, a built-in CRM solution and real-time reports. The best POS system for restaurants is Toast POS, a reasonably priced, full-featured point-of-sale platform for US-based foodservice companies.</p>
<p>Tight integration between the point of sale software and the cash drawer is a must. It provides payment processing through Vantiv, and you can purchase its POS hardware either directly from the company or from Amazon. With lack of access to processed business information, retailers earlier operated on demand forecasts based on intuitions and gut feelings. Other advantages include the ability to implement various types of discounts, a loyalty scheme for customers, and more efficient stock control, and these features are typical of almost all modern ePOS systems.</p>

Remember that CardSmart Merchant Services has two additional point of sale systems, either of which would be an excellent choice.</p>
