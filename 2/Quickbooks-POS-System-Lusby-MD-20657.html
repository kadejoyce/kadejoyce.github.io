<p>A restaurant management system helps a restaurant manage all the different types of orders, menus, shifts, tables, billings, payments and everything on all counts. Accurate wait times reduce walk-away customers and no-shows and let diners check-in before arrival. For example, they were responsible for scheduling employee hours and tracking time cards, compiling many tedious manager reports meticulously by hand, tracking all sales, running inventory checks, handling reservations, and generating other necessary reports vital to the operation of the business.</p>
<p>Since implementation of a POS system is requires a large investment in time and money, the selection of software and hardware requires careful research into the features available and associated costs.

Many small businesses benefit from buying their POS hardware outright, since POS leases can be tied to credit card processing and have lengthy contracts.</p>
