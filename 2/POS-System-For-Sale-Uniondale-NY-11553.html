<p>The Point of Sale system from QuickBooks has always captured the attention and curiosity of many people. Swipe your customer's card and open a bar tab quickly. Cova is the perfect POS system for cannabis retailers. Select from complete solutions featuring QuickStore software and a Cash Drawer, Pole Display, Receipt Printer and Barcode Scanner.

It's also complete with features such as financial data analysis, inventory management, customer loyalty programs, payment gateways, delivery management, and currency exchange.</p>
<p>Features include order management, a delivery app for drivers, employee scheduling and a timeclock, ingredient-based inventory tracking, and reporting tools. The software is essentially an online ordering platform for restaurants, convenience stores, takeaways, multi-store chains, cafes, delis, and franchises.
