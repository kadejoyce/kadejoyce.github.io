<p>These services are critical for ensuring that the system and network are set up properly and that you and your staff feel comfortable using all of the different features effectively. A big advantage here is that you can download Lightspeed POS to your own equipment - you don't need to buy new hardware from Lightspeed in order to operate its software.
