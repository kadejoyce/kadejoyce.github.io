<p>Onetap is hospitality point of sale, stock control, customer loyalty, reporting and integrated software using smart technology for restaurants, cafes, bars and more. You also get dashboards, retail, and product report to gain insights into your store's growth and sales performance. If you already own a PC you can "create" a POS by purchasing the POS software and adding the peripherals you will need such as a cash drawer, credit card swiper, etc. High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can monitor the sales made by your servers and manage security permissions on the POS. With POS Software you will be able to capture complete transaction details at the point of sale, and transaction history and real-time database records are stored indefinitely so your data is always available for reporting and analysis. Mobile point of sale systems that utilize handheld tablets eliminate the clunky technology that typically stands between staff and guests.</p>

<p>But when it comes to providing detailed sales reports, some systems blow others out of the water. Linga POS is an iPad POS system for restaurants from Benseron Hospitality. If the restaurant has primarily chosen a cloud-based POS system but their internet is not 100% reliable, they can connect an on-site server enabling the software to function when the internet is down and sync the data in the cloud when the internet is back up and running.</p>

<p>You'll need to consider software for restaurant and bar inventory, purchase and invoicing, accounting, reservation, and scheduling. While some retailers still use systems as described above, many are moving on to advanced cloud-based POS systems where data is stored online. Bottom Line: Intuit QuickBooks Point of Sale offers a solid base in its existing financial software and the basics of a good point-of-sale (POS) product.</p>
