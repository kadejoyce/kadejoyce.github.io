<p>This multipurpose system works for nightclubs, bars, full service, fast, and casual restaurants, as well as bakeries and food trucks.

<p>You need to make sure that the POS hardware - the scanners, computers, and printers - is compatible with the software you have chosen. Because of the importance of accurate data capture in sophisticated point-of-sale systems, retailers are increasingly turning to scanning as an alternative to error-prone keypunch entry."
