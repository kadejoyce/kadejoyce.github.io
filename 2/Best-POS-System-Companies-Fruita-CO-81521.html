<p>When you are decided to get started in a restaurant business, there is no simpler way to get going but by opening a small pizza shop. Choosing a POS software vendor that offers proprietary hardware can save you time while offering smoother functionality. Easy to use - Tablet and mobile POS are easier to use because the staff is already familiar with using mobile devices so that the learning curve can be shorter over the traditional point of sale machines and software. Our parent company Point of Sale USA maintains a list of the top restaurant POS systems in the industry with individual reviews to help you compare and find the right solution for your business.</p>
<p>Start using Hike POS software with a 14-day free trial and get it ready for retail in 3 easy steps. In addition to checking out customers and recording sales data, it becomes the hub of your business, bringing together information about your sales, inventory, customers, and employees, so you can manage your business more efficiently.

Designed for restaurants, cafes, and bars-really any business with a menu-TouchBistro is a successful Point of Sale application that runs solely on mobile iPads that are synchronized through a local network.</p>
<p>Point-of-sale systems, as a result, are basically cash registers on steroids.‚Äù POS software expanded the basics of the cash register directly into credit card payment processors and back-end accounting. Since the point-of-sale system was now keeping an individual record for each inventory item, retailers wanted to maintain their stocking levels in the computer. From inventory management and sales tracking, to sales reporting and customer loyalty programs, AIMsi covers it all.</p>

Meet the real side of your retail business and never again blind-guess your store performance. There are many kinds of payment processing solutions available to use such as new mobile payment methods and credit card readers, however, the POS systems we reviewed for this article are full-on cash registers.</p>
<p>Mobile POS systems are always less expensive, especially if you already own tablets. To be completely accurate, we can say that POS refers to the hardware and software which cashiers use for checkouts. Identifying your customers is even faster with loyalty cards and customer barcode ids. 22 The report goes on to say that "the number of franchise restaurants impacted by these cyber security attacks is now expected to be considerably higher than the 300 restaurants already implicated" and that the "hackers made hundreds of thousands of fraudulent purchases on credit and debit cards issued by various financial institutions after breaching Wendy's computer systems late last year".</p>
