<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments. Be cautious, therefore, about setting up with Quickbooks or other proprietary POS software systems.</p>
<p>Clover is an all-in-one point-of-sale and payment system for restaurants that integrates the functions of a cash register, card payment terminal, and POS system. With today's modernized POS systems for bars, creating an engaging loyalty program that customers want to participate in is easy. For example, restaurants, retail businesses, and grocery stores all have their specialties and that is why they need a POS system that meets their specific needs.</p>
