It's affordable, easy to use and packed with features for all types of retail businesses, including fashion boutiques, car washes, computer shops, bike shops and other specialty stores.</p>
<p>On the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier POS station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed. While its Square Point of Sale App is an all-in-one software for pretty much any business, Square for Restaurants is rather an optimized version with the specific features that restaurant business owners need. POS functions include employee scheduling and management, sales reporting, inventory management and more.</p>

One associated benefit for restaurant owners is the elimination of miscommunication between customers, servers, and kitchen staff; Orders can be sent straight from the customer to the kitchen, increasing efficiency and reducing mistakes.
