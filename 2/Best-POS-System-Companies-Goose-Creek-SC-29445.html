<p>Point of sales systems of today function analogously to the commonplace personal computer and can run other software other than the standard POS software that is provided as standard with the purchase of the system. The Point of Sale (POS) is simply the place where a retail transaction takes place-it's the hardware and software used to physically accept payments and record transactions.

<p>Point of sale equipment allows faster payment service thereby reducing the amount of time a shopper has to wait to pay for their items.
