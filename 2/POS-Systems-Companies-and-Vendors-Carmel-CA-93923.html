<p>Whether you're selling gardening supplies, trendy clothes, or high-end electronics, your retail store's success is largely connected to your cash management procedures. And an open API makes adding third-party applications far easier than with the majority of restaurant POS systems. Customers appreciate when their food is delivered on time, and when their orders are not mixed up. For a restaurant this could mean greater customer retention, and more satisfied clients. By empowering in-store associates with a customer's purchase history, online browsing, and cart abandons, POS can increase basket size and same-store sales, even as you drive loyalty by exceeding customer expectations.</p>
<p>When you've got the basics of good inventory management and great customer service in place, you can devote mental energy to creating an immersive, interactive experience in your stores. Vend POS is one the most flexible Retail POS Systems on the market, boasting third-party add-ons galore and compatibility with many operating systems. Now the systems that process checks and credit cards are an integral part of many POS systems.</p>
