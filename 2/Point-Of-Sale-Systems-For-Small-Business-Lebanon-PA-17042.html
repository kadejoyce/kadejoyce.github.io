Point-of-sale systems, or POS, are the retail software and hardware merchants use to process in-person transactions. POS once referred only to the site—typically, a counter with a cash register where customers handed over cash for goods and services. Traditionally, POS systems were physical cash registers that accepted only cash, checks, and credit cards.</p>

With the proliferation of low-priced touchscreen tablet computers, more and more restaurants have implemented self-ordering through tablet POS placed permanently on every table.</p>
