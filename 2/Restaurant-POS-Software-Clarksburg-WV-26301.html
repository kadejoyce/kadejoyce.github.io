<p>Whether you're selling gardening supplies, trendy clothes, or high-end electronics, your retail store's success is largely connected to your cash management procedures. And an open API makes adding third-party applications far easier than with the majority of restaurant POS systems. Customers appreciate when their food is delivered on time, and when their orders are not mixed up. For a restaurant this could mean greater customer retention, and more satisfied clients. By empowering in-store associates with a customer's purchase history, online browsing, and cart abandons, POS can increase basket size and same-store sales, even as you drive loyalty by exceeding customer expectations.</p>
<p>Consequently, you should be able to freely embed card readers, bar code scanners, receipt printers, cash drawers, etc. Equipping your bar service and table service programs with these handheld devices will allow your staff to provide guests with the best possible service.

<p>The most prominent makers of iPad POS systems also piggyback their point-of-sale solutions with digital menus that are powered by the iPad tablets.

In short the software makes running the retail store easily and conveniently.</p>
