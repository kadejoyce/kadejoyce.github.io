While many of the functions of POS software can be done simply with pen and paper and a cash register, POS tools keep all that information easily accessible in one place.</p>
<p>On the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier POS station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed. While its Square Point of Sale App is an all-in-one software for pretty much any business, Square for Restaurants is rather an optimized version with the specific features that restaurant business owners need.
