<p>Onetap is hospitality point of sale, stock control, customer loyalty, reporting and integrated software using smart technology for restaurants, cafes, bars and more. You also get dashboards, retail, and product report to gain insights into your store's growth and sales performance. If you already own a PC you can "create" a POS by purchasing the POS software and adding the peripherals you will need such as a cash drawer, credit card swiper, etc. High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>With Harbortouch's free POS program, we'd be remiss by not adding a retail point of sale system to our product line of software and hardware products. The user can use cash, debit cards, mobile payments, or credit cards for the payment. It can be all too easy to lose track of someone's drink order or miss a customer waiting to place a drink order at the bar. Here is an ugly truth: No matter how credit card improves, cash still holds its position on consumers' behavior.</p>

It lets retailers manage the product's along with the inventory. But it should be clear that the more extensive the restaurant service, the more advanced and varied the POS software must be to fully support all daily operations.</p>
