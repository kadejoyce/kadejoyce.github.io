<p>This feature has been around since I started in the cash register business some 25+ years ago. Formerly known as iConnect, Franpos provides POS solutions with comprehensive features to franchise businesses. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business.

<h3>POS Point Of Sale Software System Medford Oregon</h3>
<p>For example, sending a sale flyer for 30% off on oversized shirts” to the customer who wears a medium sized shirt would be a waste of time. As you can see, there are many options and features to consider when it comes to retail POS technology. In the industry-specific software, there are features of inventory management. A dishonest cashier at a retail outlet can collude with a friend who pretends to be just another customer.</p>
<p>Bluestore is a simple and affordable POS system that works on different types of hardware, including iPads. I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc.</p>
