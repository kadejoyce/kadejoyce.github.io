<p>There are a lot of products which can be used in the restaurant or food franchising industry and one of them is through the use of the POS systems or Point of Sale systems. Operating a retail store calls for a range of administrative, management and marketing skills. Opting for a POS software provider that offers both proprietary and open source hardware, provides you with the most freedom and flexibility which ultimately results in the most bang for your buck. The cash drawer should be compatible with the rest of the system if purchasing the POS hardware separately. A mobile web study found out that smartphones were used in over a third of total US retail sales in 2018 or equivalent to more than $1 trillion in purchases.</p>
<p>POS systems let retailers track their inventory across multiple stores in different locations. These options may also encourage your customers to spend more money at your business. You can connect the POS system with most-used business applications and payment systems, like Paypal, Xero, and Quickbooks. In addition to helping owners and operators detect theft through detailed sales and inventory reporting, some bar and nightclub POS systems also offer cash drawer management to further protect against employee theft.</p>
<h2>Managing Your Restaurant Inventory Wisely Jackson</h2>
<p>The best POS systems give you a choice of credit card processing companies to work with, and you'll pay whichever processor you decide to use various fees, such as a percentage of each sale plus a per-transaction fee.

TouchBistro's restaurant POS system features can accommodate small, mid-sized, and large restaurant businesses.</p>
<p>But other retail locations may prefer a mobile POS for staff to use out on the floor.
