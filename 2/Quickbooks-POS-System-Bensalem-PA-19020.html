<p>POS stands for "point of sale" and it is generally used to describe the computer used to check out customers. With a good (POS) point of sale system, you can keep customers loyal, and keep them spending. By nature of processing the outward flow of your business's inventory, point of sale systems—the best ones, anyway—keep track of where your inventory currently stands. When doing so, remember that you will need to invest in a server (unless the system will work with your existing one) retail software, accounting software, terminals (how many will you need?) Talking to other business owners is a good way to get an idea of the range of what's out there in terms of price.</p>
<p>Lightspeed is an iPad POS system that has solutions for retail stores, restaurants and online businesses. The traditional restaurant Point Of Sale brought with itself the miracle of customer data. Upserve POS focuses on small restaurants but can also accommodate large, multilocation bars. For delivery restaurants, Revel lets employees quickly store customer information with an address field.

<p>Manage Specials - POS systems automate the process of tracking current and marked down pricing. Bar menus change all the time, and your point of sale system should adapt to it. Whether you offer happy hour specials or a new food item on your menu, you want a system that can sync all the information. Improves inventory management, a crucial component of a busy deli. Menu item cost is a significant result of how computer technology improves bar and grill business.</p>
