<p>POS is a short form for point of sale. Users can utilize numerous features for managing customer information, dashboards and reports, promotions and pricing, main product catalog, orders, inventory, and cash. However, a POS terminal is the electronic equipment performing the sales transaction and processing the credit card payments. Lightspeed users can also consult the Lightspeed Community to discuss their POS system with other retailers, restaurateurs and Lightspeed experts.</p>
<p>Thus, a retail owner should take a careful matching of POS softwares and hardwares. It's our fastest reader ever - processing payments in seconds - and it's easy to integrate with our POS software. You should choose cloud-based bar POS software that enables order taking, payment processing, employee management, inventory tracking, data recording and real-time reporting. If you're in need of a POS that has great robust inventory management built in to it then I suggest you give the Hike a test and consider it.</p>

The right POS system can make your life easier — and improve the experience for your customers — while the wrong one can really set you back. They do, however, need to concern themselves with how much their bartenders are being tipped and how easy it is for customers to leave a gratuity, especially when completing transactions via a card or wallet app.</p>
<p>Though the technology of POS systems is continually evolving, it's through our maintenance and service of both your POS software and hardware that you can be rest assured that your system will stay up to date. Talech is perfect for restaurants and bars. One of these functions are the synergies created by integrating them with other back-end applications such as customer relationship management (CRM) and inventory management.</p>

Flexible devices to accept payments with consistent, low credit card rates. Many bar owners look for other helpful POS software features, like a fast user interface, tab transfer and selection, tip accounting, and surcharge and cash discount capabilities. Restaurant Software -FusionResto software lets you manage & run your restaurant business more efficiently through intuitive features.</p>
<p>One of the main advantages of restaurant POS software is the inclusion of a cash drawer (and potentially an iPad) to be used either at the counter or tableside.

ETP has successfully executed over 500 enterprise software projects across 35,000+ stores for 300+ brands.
