<p>Run the world's best retail with Vend POS software + PayPal. Restaurants can choose high-end table management and reservations options or minimized features needed for fast food counters to food trucks. The restaurant POS industry charges per-month costs that vary depending on the number of terminals and locations, and whether you're only using software or need hardware as well. Because cashless payments are typically quicker and more efficient, which leave the customer with more time to do their thing.</p>
<p>Retailers and restaurants can benefit from comprehensive data analytics and sales processing. One thing to watch out for is that sometimes these features are included in the basic monthly software fee while other times they need to be purchased, upping the price.

<p>Unlike the traditional cash register system where you cannot tell which staff member on shift rang up the sale, if you upgrade your POS equipment, you will be able to tell which staff member does what. With this software, you can increase your sales, track inventories, manage employees, and automate restaurant operations conveniently using your tablet.
