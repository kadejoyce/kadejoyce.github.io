<p>When we consider a POS system, it has to be divided into hardware and software.

Its innovative modular design allows users to easily manage all areas of operation, including the POS, Inventory, Staff and Accounting.</p>

Because of the importance of accurate data capture in sophisticated point-of-sale systems, retailers are increasingly turning to scanning as an alternative to error-prone keypunch entry."
