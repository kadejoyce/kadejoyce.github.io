For multiple terminals, additional PC server will be needed to consolidate all sales data and provide more sophisticate reporting to management. This POS system boasts special features for retailers operating hardware stores, pharmacies and boutiques. Offline Functionalities - Although your internet service provider probably guarantees an uninterrupted internet connection, you cannot afford to risk your restaurant business by taking their word for it. Instead, you should be prepared for possible downtimes by leveraging a restaurant POS system that maintains normal business operations even after going offline.</p>
<p>Some restaurants are adopting a customer-facing POS with tabletop devices providing upsells and remote service. Using integrated technology to track data helps retailers catch discrepancies in pricing or cash flow that could lead to profit loss or interrupt sales.
