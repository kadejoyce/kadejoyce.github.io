<p>Integrating the POS system with Apparel ERP will demand an understanding and the need of POS system. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>

More importantly, however, the right POS system will allow bar and nightclub staff to spend less time in front of the screen and more time in front of customers, pouring delicious drinks. In a way, this is similar to the purpose behind restaurants: A restaurant's basic function is to feed people, but you and your staff do way more than that by creating delightful, memorable dining experiences.</p>
<p>With additional features such as accounting or restaurant reservations , restaurant managers and owners can keep an eye on their business. With today's fast-paced, service-oriented restaurants you need a fast, intuitive and streamline POS system to compete.

<h3>Point Of Sale Industry Jackson AL 36545</h3>
<p>When the products have been received (Sales Order), the work has been performed, (Work Order) or the customer has picked up their merchandise (Layaway), it is important that you complete the sale and remove the goods sold from inventory. The store associate uses a mobile POS system by attaching shopping carts with tablet computers and Apple iTouch.

<p>Point of Sale (POS): The most important aspect of any point of sale (POS) retail side is speed, speed and speed. Plenty of businesses still get by with just a simple cash drawer and card reader.
