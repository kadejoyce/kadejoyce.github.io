<p>As the world is becoming cashless, more and more business are adopting cashless payment solutions, one of which is automatic payroll deduction. Reliable bar software should also offer beverage service-specific features, such as being able to transfer tabs and split checks and run customer tabs. The module provides reports that save you time and enable you to gain the insights you need to make data-driven business decisions. If you also serve food at your bar and restaurant, chances are you'll need tablets and kitchen printers too. Lightspeed Retail POS has a bit of clunky user interface, but it has all the features that most smaller retailers will be looking for in a point of sale solution.</p>

<p>A reliable restaurant POS system is the difference between a coffee shop or bar that feels like a disorganized open market, and one where customers enjoy the convenience of ordering remotely from their mobile phones, or perhaps booking tables beforehand and then having their orders delivered right on time. Manage your sales, loyalty program and inventory from a smartphone or tablet. Any store that has a point of sale and point of purchase can use POS software.</p>
