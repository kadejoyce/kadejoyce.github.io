<p>Trying to manage and grow a restaurant using old, antiquated processes like hand written order slips is a huge waste of time and energy. A credit card swipe is integrated with the POS system to quickly and accurately approve the customer's credit card and to input the transaction into the system. IVend POS is Windows OS based software that allows for a variety of peripherals and device configurations, including scanners, cash drawers, displays and EMV-compliant card readers. That's because it's the software that lets you track sales, issue receipts, and perform back-office functions.</p>
<p>Point of sale systems have revolutionized the restaurant industry, particularly in the fast food sector. Service is outstanding and POSsible POS team members are expert in integrating and setting up our complex menus and credit card processing.

From inventory management, custom barcode printing, and purchase order creation, the platform has all the features you need to handle the sales process and implement fast checkouts.</p>
<p>We focus on making the software work with the best and most commonly used retail hardware and we've heard from retailers using Vend successfully with printers we've haven't heard of. Our POS software is designed to suit a range of hospitality business types, from cafes and restaurants and bars to multi-site restaurant groups and national service organisations. But, using a POS that is tailored to retail isn't wise because a restaurant is a completely different business with different needs.</p>

To have a global solution, this tool supports up to 11 major languages, including Arabic, so customers from different parts of the world can easily shop in your store.

Make easy for customers for returns, refunds and email receipts by using this software.</p>
<p>Although its focus is hospitality businesses, salons and retail stores can also use it. You can use it to take orders tableside, track inventory at the ingredient level, manage customers, offer loyalty promotions and generate reports. With POS systems that offer this feature, you'll be able to track transaction history, take notes, and potentially even contact customers, all through your point of sale. This was the first commercially available POS system with a widget-driven color graphic touch screen interface and was installed in several restaurants in the US and Canada.</p>
