Here is an ugly truth: No matter how credit card improves, cash still holds its position on consumers' behavior.</p>

<p>Point of Sale (POS): The most important aspect of any point of sale (POS) retail side is speed, speed and speed. Plenty of businesses still get by with just a simple cash drawer and card reader. It lets retailers manage the product's along with the inventory. But it should be clear that the more extensive the restaurant service, the more advanced and varied the POS software must be to fully support all daily operations.</p>
