<p>If you are planning on starting a new retail business, or run a retail business and wish to streamline your operation, a crucial component that should be factored into your business plans is a modern day point of sale system and more precisely the benefits a good POS system can offer to the running of your business. Acquire, retain and engage your customers, increase their average spend, manage inventory and visualize sales analytics. Wearables like Disney's Magicband may seem relegated to expensive experiences for now, but wearable computing will soon change how restaurants interact with customers and accept payment. Shopkeep POS has the best Retail POS System mobile app on the market.

You can connect the POS system with most-used business applications and payment systems, like Paypal, Xero, and Quickbooks. In addition to helping owners and operators detect theft through detailed sales and inventory reporting, some bar and nightclub POS systems also offer cash drawer management to further protect against employee theft.</p>

Many POS software can be integrated to 3rd party software such as accounting software for bookkeeping, email marketing solutions, and ecommerce platforms for selling online.</p>
