<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>Lightspeed is an iPad POS system that has solutions for retail stores, restaurants and online businesses. The traditional restaurant Point Of Sale brought with itself the miracle of customer data. Upserve POS focuses on small restaurants but can also accommodate large, multilocation bars. For delivery restaurants, Revel lets employees quickly store customer information with an address field. Despite Cybersys POS's low pricing, it comes with all the features of your standard POS systems like ecommerce integration, reporting, inventory management, and employee access management.</p>

<p>Business managers need to look at the lifetime cost of the Point of Sale Systems. Connect with your customers: for those of you using a Yelp business user account, connect with all your customers and get their reviews to improve your business. Another factor that determines how much you'll pay for hardware is whether you use a legacy terminal or a mobile POS system. A right POS should also keep track of inventory at other branches and provide continuous insights on product sales.</p>
<p>For businesses at prime locations where real estate comes at a premium, it can be common to see a queue of customers. In addition to POS systems for restaurants, NerdWallet has compared a host of POS systems for other types of small businesses. Modern mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) software and credit card readers let businesses use mobile devices, like iPads, to process customer payments from almost anywhere.</p>
<p>Not only this, customers can avail the software's loyalty features to collect points and redeem these when needed. Another open source POS software option is Floreant The software was created to help a Denny's restaurant in Oneonta, New York, upgrade its system in 2008, and it has been downloaded over 122,000 times. With traditional licensed based POS system, the only knowledge possible to obtain prior to purchase comes from words from your sales rep or doing as much research as possible to find reviews online.</p>

This system offers myriad features including multi-tender options, the ability to issue store credit, inventory management, the ability to buy items in bulk and sell them individually, purchase ordering, employee management, CRM, reporting, and multi-store capability.</p>
<p>A big portion of these business owners are afraid of investing the time and money in a POS system to only end up regretting it because it just didn't work as they had hoped for. It used to be that smaller businesses could not easily process credit card and check payments. ShopKeep's tablet POS system empowers you to strategically place staff throughout the store, minimizing long wait times during peak business hours.</p>

<p>Employee management- The point of sale software administers the staffing levels, sales performance, and employee hours that ultimately help in tracking employee productivity. Sometimes the term POS may be used interchangeably with the term point of service, as customers may use the same technology to make returns. In a restaurant, it's necessary to have reliable, durable POS hardware. These systems make it possible for you to operate your entire business.</p>
