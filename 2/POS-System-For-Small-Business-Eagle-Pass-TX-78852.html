There are hundreds of different kinds of retail management systems on the market. Internet disconnection is no problem as you can continue with your selling operation with the system automatically resyncing your sales when you get back online.</p>

Features include appointment scheduling, employee management, inventory tracking, integrated payment processing, and gift card and loyalty programs.</p>
