<p>Over the last few years, there have been several advancements in restaurant POS Before we look at how the restaurant point of sale system has evolved over the years, let us first define what exactly is a point of sale system. As in other software industries, many POS vendors have cloud-based SaaS (software as a service) plans that you subscribe to. These tend to be the most affordable options. The cash only retail business is quickly fading into obscurity.</p>

<p>The system is also renowned for accepting multiple payment options, including credit cards and cash. More sophisticated POS software will actually compile data on purchases, customer history (so that big spenders can get premiere treatment), what items are moving well and what items stay stagnant. When staff members spend more time with your guests, your bar or nightclub's efficiency and reputation drastically improve.</p>
<p>Liquor costs in the restaurant and bar industry are typically 18-20% of total liquor sales The more you can optimize your liquor cost percentage, the more money your business will make. With the Toast Go mobile POS solution, you will be able to accept orders and process payments from wherever the customers are seated in the bar. We offer our point of sale software, hardware, menu programming, and installation with no upfront costs.</p>

Admittedly, quite a good bargain when you consider the thousands of dollars various restaurant businesses pay to acquire and install hardware POS.
