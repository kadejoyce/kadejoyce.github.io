<p>This feature has been around since I started in the cash register business some 25+ years ago. Formerly known as iConnect, Franpos provides POS solutions with comprehensive features to franchise businesses. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
<p>You get three software versions to choose from - Basic, Pro, and Multi-Store, all designed to help you ring sales, take payments, track customer data, and generate reports. Lastly, today's liquor POS software makes it easy to track individual ingredients , so you know exactly how many drinks, appetizers and other products you can offer guests before you're out of stock.

<p>Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (as of 2009) per checkout lane.

To get the best deal on your retail POS system, look for companies that offer month-to-month contracts and open-source POS hardware. Read real customer reviews to see why retailers choose Cumulus Retail over other retail management and ePOS systems, such as Lightspeed, Springboard, Vend, Shopkeep and more.</p>

<h3>What Is A POS (Point Of Sale) System Bennettsville South Carolina</h3>
<p>If you're choosing a POS system for the first time, start making a list of features you must have and talk to fellow business owners who are operating in a similar space. Whether you run a clothing store, a sporting goods store, or a specialty service-based business such as a car wash or computer shop, Vend has the features you need. EMV payments are processed by dipping a credit card into a slot in the card reader and allowing it to read the microchip.</p>
<p>AB POS is one of the top retail POS solutions that offer robust POS terminals, ecommerce gateways, and software apps.
