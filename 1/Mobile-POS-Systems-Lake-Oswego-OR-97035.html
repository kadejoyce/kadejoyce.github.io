Their customizable dashboard offers real-time updates on product information, sales numbers, and employee performance from any device. Logic F&B restaurant management software helps businesses in the food and beverage industry with daily operations, point of sale functions and kitchen processes (recipe management) for food courts, cafe, bars, ice cream parlors, quick service restaurants (QSR), etc.</p>

<h3>Free Restaurant POS Software Lake Oswego Oregon</h3>
<p>With the Harbortouch Bar & Restaurant table management feature, you can see how many people are at a table, and see which tables are occupied or vacant. Armed with that information, you can reduce labor costs, increase your inventory's return on investment (ROI), predict high-volume sales periods, identify your star employees, and much more. The user interface of Vision Store and Store Mobile is so robust, associates can execute a handful of requests in one easy, uninterrupted step: a purchase here, a return there, a loyalty card, a web order inquiry, a custom order — no problem.</p>
<p>We believe that restaurant point of sale and inventory management software should be mobile and affordable. Customers rate their experience alerting managers when a patron isn't satisfied with the service. Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle. Bottom Line: Paying with your iPhone via the Apple Pay mobile-payment system is a convenient and secure experience, but for now it's not possible all that often.</p>
<h3>The Point Of Sale Lake Oswego OR 97035</h3>
<p>Many owners and manages find that the reports generated from the POS system invaluable in the day-to-day and long term management of the business. Meanwhile, the Smart Table Management gives you the real-time status of your tables so that you can keep a close tab on orders and payments. It's fully mobile, so you can check inventory from anywhere in the store, show customers product images and descriptions, and ring up orders and accept payments on the sales floor or, for restaurants, tableside.</p>
<p>If you end up with a system that skimps in this department, you may find yourself having to find other, separate software apps for things like accounting, inventory, and employee management. You can also run email marketing, customer loyalty plans, and gift card programs from Square's point-of-sale software. A point-of-sale, or POS, system is the hardware and software that allows a business to process customer payments for products and services.</p>
