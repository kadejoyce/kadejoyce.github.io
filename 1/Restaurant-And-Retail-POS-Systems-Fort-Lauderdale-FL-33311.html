<p>As your business grows ShopKeep's retail store software is designed to help you pivot with advanced features. But I had breakfast with a group of retailers and I asked them what kind of retail software point of sale (POS) systems they were using. Apart from order management, restaurant table management, payment handling, inventory management, employee management, and menu management, it comes with CRM capabilities- all of which we've repeatedly tried, tested and confirmed that they indeed perform well.</p>
<p>From invoicing to time clocking, Bindo has more than 300 features designed to streamline business operations.

<p>Traditionally, POS systems were on-premise, which means they used an on-site server and could only run in a specific area of your store.

You can accept payment right in the online invoice, and customers can pay by credit card, Apple Pay, free ACH bank transfer, or over the phone.</p>
