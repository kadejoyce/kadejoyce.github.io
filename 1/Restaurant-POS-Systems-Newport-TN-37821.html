<p>A Point of Sale (POS) system is indispensable for any type of retail business. Cloud-based Point of Sale software that easily adapts to support the evolving needs of customers. Some restaurant POS systems will even contain features to facilitate creating an online menu and delivery service that can be embedded into a website. Bar point of sale software also helps modernize your bar business by opening doors that grant access to cloud technology, mobile payments, and essential customer analytics data.</p>
<p>It means the point of sale transaction or deal that happens between a merchant and a customer at the time of purchasing the product or service. It has a built-in queue capability that handles long lines without the need to take numbers; all your customers need to do is sit back until the next sales agent is available. With the right bar management software and technology, owners and operators can increase their profit margins and better understand both their business and their customers.</p>
<h2>POS Systems Are More Than Just A Cash Register Newport</h2>
<p>Salesforce Commerce Cloud also gives you the kind of support provided by the massive Salesforce ecosystem, paving an easy path to globalize your operations with full support for local languages and currencies. Newer technology services on the market like cloud-based and hybrid point of sale solutions run on iPads and tablets where your data is synced and stored online and eliminates the need for an on-premise server like with legacy software and hardware.</p>

Online Order Integration: Integration with Zomato, Swiggy and other ordering channels is easy, allowing you to manage every order from the POS.</p>
<p>It's also easy to open and close tabs for customers by simply swiping their credit card through the system. The Lightspeed restaurant EPOS also comes equipped with a high-tech restaurant management software which can be customised to your needs. Sales - Simplified checkouts for both, business and customers. Card machine: Used to process payments made by debit or credit cards or mobile wallets via NFC.
