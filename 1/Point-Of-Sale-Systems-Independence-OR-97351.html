<p>There are a lot of products which can be used in the restaurant or food franchising industry and one of them is through the use of the POS systems or Point of Sale systems. Operating a retail store calls for a range of administrative, management and marketing skills. Opting for a POS software provider that offers both proprietary and open source hardware, provides you with the most freedom and flexibility which ultimately results in the most bang for your buck. The cash drawer should be compatible with the rest of the system if purchasing the POS hardware separately. A mobile web study found out that smartphones were used in over a third of total US retail sales in 2018 or equivalent to more than $1 trillion in purchases.</p>

<p>Bluestore is a simple and affordable POS system that works on different types of hardware, including iPads. I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc.</p>
