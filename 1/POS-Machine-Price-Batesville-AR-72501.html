Cloud-based and on-premise solution that allows restaurants to streamline point-of-sale operations with scheduling, reporting and more. You can analyze sales data, figure out how well all the items on your shelves sell, and adjust purchasing levels accordingly. Beyond ringing up sales and accepting payments, you want a system that streamlines related processes such as inventory and customer management. A retail POS system may also include a barcode scanner and customer-facing screen.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well.
