<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments. Be cautious, therefore, about setting up with Quickbooks or other proprietary POS software systems.</p>
<p>Transactions are fully integrated into the sales process to allow for faster checkout experience for your customers. These features make it easy to accept payment from customers. Small restaurant businesses like cafes, pizzerias, nightclubs and bars can capitalize on the software's advanced menu creation and table mapping capabilities, while large franchises would be more interested in taking advantage of its real-time multi-location data syncing.</p>
