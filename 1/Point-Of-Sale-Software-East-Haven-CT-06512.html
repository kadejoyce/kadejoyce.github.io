<p>It used to be that for a small retail business, a cash register and a black-box credit card terminal were sufficient. Before the introduction of technology into the restaurants, bills were traditionally generated by merely calculating the order value manually and giving customers a handwritten receipt. The payment options offered, the speed of the transaction, and the ability to tailor the transaction to the customers' needs each have profound impacts on customer satisfaction and your overall business success. It is advisable to use your POS computer exclusively for the purpose it is meant for - recording sales transactions, generating reports and managing inventory.</p>
<p>Point of sale systems allows the service staff to quickly take multiple orders and submit them to the computerized kitchen staff for cooking. All you need is an email ID to setup and install Waiterio POS for your restaurant business. It is an iPad-based solution perfect for restaurants, bars, and retail stores. Bar POS System : Pour spouts can be linked to the POS software to ensure that bar tenders are not over pouring drinks and cutting into profits.</p>

<h2>Point Of Sale Credit East Haven CT</h2>
<p>Restaurant owners were quick to realize that just acquiring customers was not enough.

<p>But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only.

While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to. Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>
