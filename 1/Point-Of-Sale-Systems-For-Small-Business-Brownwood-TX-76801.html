<p>Any retail store that wants to stay in business for a long time will appreciate every customer that walks through the front door; the question is whether or not they will choose to display that appreciation. Nowadays POS systems are also used in goods and property leasing businesses, equipment repair shops, healthcare management, ticketing offices such as cinemas and sports facilities and many other operations where capabilities such as the following are required: processing monetary transactions, allocation and scheduling of facilities, keeping record and scheduling services rendered to customers, tracking of goods and processes (repair or manufacture), invoicing and tracking of debts and outstanding payments.</p>
<p>You can then send them special offers and sale notices with Odoo Mailing Register tax identifications for your business customers and give them invoices instantly (or send by email). Mobile apps have turned phones into portable payment kiosks, minimizing hardware requirements, while enabling retailers to take the transaction from the counter to the sales floor and beyond. Point of sale represents the area where retail businesses conduct their most intensive data entry.</p>
