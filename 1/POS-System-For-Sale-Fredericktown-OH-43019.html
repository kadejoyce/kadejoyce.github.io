<h3>The Importance Of CRM And How A POS System Can Help Fredericktown Ohio</h3>
<p>PointOS was founded by bar and restaurant professionals to provide a cost effective, full-featured and user-friendly restaurant management platform that helps restaurants and bars operate more efficiently and profitably. This free POS software can perform all of the common register functions, track up to 13,000 SKU's, monitor sales of up to 56 employees, and handle daily sales reporting. When we started, we used to write all of our sales on a piece of paper, but soon we realised that we needed an efficient POS to automate our work.</p>
<p>Depending on the program, customers can store up points or earn rewards based on the amount of money they spend. Create, manage and control the database of multiple restaurant sites at one time. You either lose sales or have to rely on your cashiers to add and total your sales properly.
