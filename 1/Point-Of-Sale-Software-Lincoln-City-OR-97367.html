<p>Point of sale or POS systems are a necessary and invaluable part of most businesses. Transactions, replacing the cash registers with a Point-Of-Sale (POS) system save you money. For multiple terminals, additional PC server will be needed to consolidate all sales data and provide more sophisticate reporting to management. This POS system boasts special features for retailers operating hardware stores, pharmacies and boutiques. Offline Functionalities - Although your internet service provider probably guarantees an uninterrupted internet connection, you cannot afford to risk your restaurant business by taking their word for it.

<p>A few services, such as Square Point of Sale, offer POS services for free, as long as you process your payments through them. Tracking sales and inventory, renting videos and equipment, creating membership accounts, look ups by category, and managing your store's books are just a few of the features.
