<p>Technology has been moving at an amazing avalanche pace. This POS system has SMS messaging, inventory management, and loyalty programs, compatible with PC, Mac, iPhone, and Windows Mobile. Smartphone POS services can process payments and manage some inventory and customer information. The most basic and universal in-person payment method is the reading of a credit card magstripe via swipe. Keep a track of inventory and enjoy smooth sales operation. Keep customers coming back with seamless shopping experiences both in store and online.</p>
<p>A great POS solution will not only improve your business, but it will also enhance the overall customer experience. Relying on an iPads is also a big perk, as it saves space and makes it easy for servers, hosts, managers, and bartenders to create and edit orders anywhere. Systems such as Square Point of Sale are known for offering small dongles that connect to a tablet and let you swipe credit cards on the go. While you may not immediately need this type of mobility, it is good to know that it's available.</p>

All in all, it boasts an incredibly simple design, just set and forget, and pick and choose the features that work best for you and your business.</p>
<p>Still, for retail businesses that want a straightforward POS system for online and in-person sales, Shopify packs a potent punch. There are two main components in restaurant pos hardware and system, the front desk and the back kitchen. Management features include Payroll, EMV Chip Tabs, Employee activity tracking, Real time training, Extensive reporting, Automated discounting, Trade accounts, Gift cards, Tickets splinting, Customer head counts, Table management, Customer records, Void Comp Discount Waste Override and Theft tracking system.</p>
<p>And many POS systems are capable of accepting almost any type of payment, including contactless payments like Apple Pay and Google Pay. That kind of (costly) frustration can't occur in retail stores. Ultimately, inventory is synchronized with less human error that is simply getting you real-time data and result for your business. Without a POS System, your customers will have to stand in a long line to wait for their checkout turn.</p>

<p>These registers have been replaced by technology known as point of sale (POS) systems; which nowadays are highly sophisticated and are the backbone of any business where sales are involved. The $29 Basic Shopify plan is an affordable option for smaller retail businesses, but only if you're selling products exclusively online. Disregarding that fact for the time being, compare a retail store with a POS System to an almost identical store with a standard electronic cash register - there are much differences than first meets the eye.</p>

Whether it's something as small as a smartphone plugin, or something as large as an entire countertop register, the hardware for your point of sale system will likely cost your business a one-off lump sum. With the POS technology, the system's software uses the barcode on the label of the item you bought (or the key code for the particular entr√©e or drink, in the case of a restaurant) as an inventory regulation system as well as an efficient way to control the transaction.</p>
