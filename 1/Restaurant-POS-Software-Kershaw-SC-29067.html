<p>Point of sales systems (also known as POS) are employed in retail stores, medicine counters, restaurants, hotels, clinics and basically any kinds of shops and stores across the world. Some packages are designed specifically for food and beverage service businesses, like TouchBistro and Toast. It can also mean that the system—software and cloud server—must be capable of generating reports such as analytics of sale against inventory for both a single and multiple outlets that are interlinked for administration by the headquarters of the business operation. It has different modules for billing, database management, order token management, employee and staff management, and a lot more.</p>

<p>Also, since your revenues will rise, spending time on forecasting and analysis will have a bigger return on investment, so we added features of a POS system that will help you with forecasting as well. Another advantage associated with Point of Sale software for restaurants is its real-time integration with inventory management. It is wise to use the POS computer for only sales transactions, reports, and inventory control, and isolate use of POS computers from general purpose activities.</p>
<p>But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only. It takes the payment of the customers by adding up the totals along with the sales tax. While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to. Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>
<p>These registers have been replaced by technology known as point of sale (POS) systems; which nowadays are highly sophisticated and are the backbone of any business where sales are involved. The $29 Basic Shopify plan is an affordable option for smaller retail businesses, but only if you're selling products exclusively online. Disregarding that fact for the time being, compare a retail store with a POS System to an almost identical store with a standard electronic cash register - there are much differences than first meets the eye.</p>

<p>Another fast-growing standard is the near-field communications (NFC) transaction, which is an electronic payment system being popularized by mobile giants such as Apple Pay and Google Wallet Making sure your POS system candidate can handle these new emerging systems is only half of the equation. They offer a multi-tier loyalty feature which permits business owners to track how much their customers spend, and offer rewards as they seem fit.</p>
<p>As long as you don't need to run any in-person transactions, a point of sale system that works online—with customers inputting their card info in order to pay for your business's product or services—could be all you need. If your restaurant offers delivery, choosing one of our integrated point-of-sale suppliers means you'll be able to sync with the biggest meal delivery services around the world.
