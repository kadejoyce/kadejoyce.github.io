<p>Point of sale (POS) can be referred to as a check-out or cash wrap and is usually the location in a store or restaurant where transactions for the exchange goods and services occur. Some retailers choose to operate an RMS by assembling the various pieces from different software vendors: a POS system from Vendor A, an inventory management system from Vendor B, purchasing management from Vendor C, a business intelligence tool from Vendor D, an ecommerce system from Vendor E and so on. The costs of implementing multiple disparate systems and getting them to work together in harmony is prohibitive for all but the largest retail businesses.</p>
<p>We only sell ruggedized POS hardware designed to meet the strenuous demands of busy restaurants. It is a comprehensive tool equipped with features ranging from order management and payment processing to CRM and loyalty program management.

A CPU, motherboard and memory will form the PC unit of the POS Hardware bundle, with the combination of POS input device like POS keyboard, smart card or credit card reader and barcode scanner; and output device, like customer pole display, LCD screen or touch screen, and receipt printer, all bundle together to form a proper Point of Sale machine.</p>
