<p>Shopify POS is a service that's easy to set up and highly customizable to fit small businesses and scale up as your business grows. The Basic plan gives you a few more in-store features, but it is the Shopify and Advanced Shopify that really gives you enough to run a serious brick and mortar store - with an online Shopify store. In addition to their hardware components, a POS Point of Sale terminal is running special software.</p>
<p>It lets you store customer data in a single location, access customer history, import customer lists, and provide discounts.

<p>It supports automated assembly systems, emails customers when their clothes are ready for pickup, and includes the Driver Mobile App for dry cleaning delivery and laundry routes. The retail stores are cozier and less stressful for shoppers. Manage and view customers' order history and personal information. Larger restaurants and fine dining establishments may need things like multiple server stations, hostess station systems, bar server stations and several kitchen printers, but as a small restaurant you do not.</p>
<p>So, while your sales associate is looking up stock availability from Retail Pro on an iPad or iPod Touch (or any other mobile device), they can also look up the customer's transaction history and make recommendations for cool sweaters or tees to complete their look. When you open a restaurant, cafe or bar, you need a point-of-sale system to accept credit and debit payments. Generally, if not for aesthetic purposes, the business is only using one of these because they do not have the budget for a better cash management system.</p>
