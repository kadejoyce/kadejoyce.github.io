<p>When choosing the right retail point-of-sale system (POS) for your business, it is essential to understand what type of system will best meet your needs. Over the last few months they have shifted their company from a small business to a corporation that does not care about their individual customers. The common database that serves this network must also be capable of serving many concurrent users - cashier, customers, kitchen and perhaps even a drink bar. With the diverse needs of different food establishments, no POS software is a fit-all solution. It also has a user-friendly mobile app, Revel Insights, which allows for sales analysis in real-time.</p>
<p>So when you're at your favorite restaurant or retail shop, and you make a purchase, you are completing a point-of-sale (POS) or a point of purchase (POP) transaction.

EPOS system is easy to use, and staff can be trained on it in 15 minutes.

With a point of sale system at your restaurant, you're able to track kitchen performance and order times.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, there have been several advancements in restaurant POS Before we look at how the restaurant point of sale system has evolved over the years, let us first define what exactly is a point of sale system.
