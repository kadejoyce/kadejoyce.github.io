Especially crucial for future expansion are LAN interfaces, which allow for multiple POS systems to remain connected and share data in real time.</p>

POS is not a standalone machine or process - it's a constellation of things that together enable you to process customer-facing transactions efficiently and streamline business processes connected with your sales. Once you match the right POS system to your restaurant, you can streamline operations, increase staff productivity, reduce shrinkage, and maximize profits.</p>

The price, lower than most POS software services in the restaurant business, is also a big selling point.
