<p>Like their printer counterpart an all-in-one POS system combines multiple technologies and integrates them into one housing to maximize value plus convenience to the end user. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>You may be able to use all or most of your existing hardware when you add Lightspeed to your businessâ€”speak to your sales rep for more information. Managers can also keep track of profits, inventory, menu trends, and other analytics.

<p>Labor Management and Payroll : A restaurant POS system can act as an employee time clock, with servers and staff signing in and out according to their schedules.

But when you are dealing with back-office functions like personnel management or inventory, things can sometimes go wrong.</p>
