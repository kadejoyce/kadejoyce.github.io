<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments. Be cautious, therefore, about setting up with Quickbooks or other proprietary POS software systems.</p>
<p>Consequently, you should be able to freely embed card readers, bar code scanners, receipt printers, cash drawers, etc. Equipping your bar service and table service programs with these handheld devices will allow your staff to provide guests with the best possible service. Copper is a point of sale (POS) computer software which provides a business with a cash register system. Especially desirable are fast, thermal printers to reduce wait time for customers.</p>
