Since your ecommerce and in-store solution will be connected with Shopify POS, customers will have the ability to return or exchange an online purchase at a local retail location.

With the POS technology, the system's software uses the barcode on the label of the item you bought (or the key code for the particular entr√©e or drink, in the case of a restaurant) as an inventory regulation system as well as an efficient way to control the transaction.</p>
