<p>If you run a retail store, you know that a point of sale system is essential, especially in food retailing, where large volumes of goods go through the check out. In addition, some states (such as California) now require some kind of customer-facing screen be available so customers can view sales information as a sale is rung up. Your point of sale should help you automate and optimize how you manage your business's inventory. Give your bartenders possibility to quickly and accurately serve customers and create a unique atmosphere for your bar. So, of course, restaurants handled most of their management stuff manually.</p>

<p>You should consider storing your data with a business-grade cloud storage provider that's secure and make sure that every session between your point-of-sale system and any remote location are secured through a virtual private network (VPN). It also features real-time analytics for sales tracking and other key performance indicators with actionable insights. Maybe your store makes many sales throughout the day that involve several smaller items, so a system with a scanner built into the counter might be more efficient.</p>
