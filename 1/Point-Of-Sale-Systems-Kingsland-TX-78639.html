<p>This feature has been around since I started in the cash register business some 25+ years ago. Formerly known as iConnect, Franpos provides POS solutions with comprehensive features to franchise businesses. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
<p>Your customers become your shop's ultimate cheerleader, speaking positively about you within their social circles and essentially attracting new customers for you. Consolidate your inventory, customer, and staff management across all locations so that you can manage your entire business from one place. Reduced time for management to compute employee hours. POS systems also offer reliable add-ons and hardware systems such as barcode scanners, cash drawers, receipt printers, and card swipers.</p>
<h2>Forgotten Point Of Sale System Features Kingsland</h2>
<p>Franchise bar and grills are the most up to date on computerized menu systems and are able to turnaround tables much faster than years ago, increasing sales. The right POS system can make your life easier — and improve the experience for your customers — while the wrong one can really set you back. They do, however, need to concern themselves with how much their bartenders are being tipped and how easy it is for customers to leave a gratuity, especially when completing transactions via a card or wallet app.</p>
<p>To give you a better understanding of these systems, we will present to you the 15 best POS software currently in the market. Ambur is an iPad POS system for restaurants that also works on the iPhone and iPod Touch. It's predicted that eighty percent of all enterprise (and mission-critical) workloads will move to the cloud by 2025 ( Top 10 Cloud Predictions ). To this end, many retailers are seeking a cloud-based strategy to meet employee and customer needs.</p>
<p>More established businesses can take advantage of advanced features such as kitchen display systems, digital menu boards, online ordering and self-ordering kiosks. This configurable, full-scale POS system gives your staff the mobility to do the job in all areas of the restaurant. Most POS software helps you stay aware of how your business is performing. The automation saved a retailer many hours in determining which departments contained the best selling items and how many sales dollars were generated.</p>

<p>Orders can be taken tableside and are sent directly from the waiting staff to the kitchen - meaning staff no longer have to wait for an open terminal to complete the order which cuts down the time between customers ordering and receiving their food. With Smart Tax the customer pays the sales tax on bar sales with food items. Since 2008, ShopKeep has been helping quick-service restaurants with their management needs.</p>
<p>Not only this, by using an efficient restaurant management software, you can avoid any embarrassments and possible loss of business that may be a result of overbooking, double-booking, or lags in customer service. Simply explained, every time your customer purchases your business, they're completing a point of the sale transaction. Most POS companies will program your menu or inventory items as an existing customer or additionally for a fee.</p>
<p>The need for special tax calculations arise when you sell an item in the restaurant where the tax is added onto the sale but the same item in the bar has the tax included. Clover is an advanced POS system for businesses that require highly customizable software. This is referred to as interchange-plus pricing , and is assessed because online payments are considered to be at higher risk of fraud.
