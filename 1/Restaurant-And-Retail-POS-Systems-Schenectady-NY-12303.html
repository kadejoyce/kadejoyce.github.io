Aside from POS features, TouchBistro has robust reporting and remote management.</p>
<p>If it happens to crash and you don't have a backup, then you risk losing all your data, not just sales, but profit and loss statements and payroll statements. Also available are additional hardware, including bar-code scanners and receipt printers, to use with the POS software. Our projects range from single-purpose tasks for small businesses to highly complex, multi-platform systems for large corporate clients.</p>

The $29 Basic Shopify plan is an affordable option for smaller retail businesses, but only if you're selling products exclusively online. Disregarding that fact for the time being, compare a retail store with a POS System to an almost identical store with a standard electronic cash register - there are much differences than first meets the eye.</p>
