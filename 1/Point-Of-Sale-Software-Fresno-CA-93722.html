A bar and grill, particularly a franchise where overhead is higher, properly tracking product popularity, sales and waste ultimately improves the overall bottom line of the restaurant.</p>
<p>POS hardware can be a stationary terminal or a mobile device, such as a tablet or iPad. Loyverse POS is a free point-of-sale application and is especially suited for bars, coffee shops, and restaurants.
