<p>The core of hospitality or retail business, for that matter any trade, is the cash register. A POS system provides the latest sales reports for the day, week, month, or year. You'll want to use POS software that integrates seamlessly with your other systems and causes limited disruption. In essence, Upserve POS provides tools for customer management, restaurant management, table management, and specialty order processing. Some restaurant point of sale systems come standard with an "86 Item Countdown" feature that displays actual counts, deducts from the count when an item is sold and then prevents sales of the item once it is sold out.</p>
<p>MPS is serious about delivering extraordinary merchant processing services to our clients and in doing business with impeccable integrity in order to build customer confidence to the highest possible level. This system is integrated with the restaurant's POS and can accurately predict what is in on-hand inventory, as well as forecasting the size of the next supply order. 3.
