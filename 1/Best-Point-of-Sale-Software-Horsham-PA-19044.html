<p>The core of hospitality or retail business, for that matter any trade, is the cash register. A POS system provides the latest sales reports for the day, week, month, or year. You'll want to use POS software that integrates seamlessly with your other systems and causes limited disruption. In essence, Upserve POS provides tools for customer management, restaurant management, table management, and specialty order processing. Some restaurant point of sale systems come standard with an "86 Item Countdown" feature that displays actual counts, deducts from the count when an item is sold and then prevents sales of the item once it is sold out.</p>
<p>This high-end system helps restaurants improve and grow their business. Manage Using Remote Access - Many POS system software packages give you the ability to manage the system while mobile. As well, POS software can be integrated into other applications so that all areas of business management can be viewed in one central place. The ZOOM POS solution is flexible and easy to use and will adapt to any restaurant environment.</p>

And while the software half of the POS system equation is probably most important, especially in a cloud-based solution, many retail businesses will still require a hardware half.</p>
<p>You can feel confident partnering with RPE for retail POS systems and software.

Menu, inventory and layout management are included in the basic restaurant software package, though add-ons are also available (more on that below).</p>
<p>Most restaurant POS vendors, however, supply hardware as well as software. A retail management software offers managers to keep track of performance, sale volume and more even when they are not on the floor. Traditionally, the restaurant POS system is where a customer makes a payment in exchange for goods or services. At the heart of Bluestore Live is an admin console, in which a business's data is securely stored on BlueStore's servers living in the cloud or the company's own private URL.</p>
